# EDA: Compute Units, Fees and Tips

- get compute units for every retrieved tx
- studies: descriptive stats, outlier detection
- plots: time series, boxplot

- get all the fees and tips (costs) for every retrieved tx
- studies: descriptive stats, outlier detection
- plots: time series, boxplot

# Experiment 1: Compute Units Optimization

Efforts in Compute Units Optimization is always present in an arbitrage transactions.

HO: The value of compute units in Arb tx are below the historical average of 
compute units in other transactions that involved transfers from and to same DEXs.

Data:

- dataset_a: 10 Arb transactions (Jito Explorer)
- dataset_b: 10 Non-arb transactions (pseudo-randomly picked)
